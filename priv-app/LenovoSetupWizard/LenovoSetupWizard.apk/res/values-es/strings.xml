"<b>\"Software Product\"</b>" includes mobile device software programs (whether preinstalled or provided separately) and related licensed materials such as documentation.
"<b>\"You\"</b> and <b>\"Your\"</b>" refer either to an individual person or to a single legal entity.

Lenovo may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If Lenovo does so, You must destroy all copies of the Software Product.
Lenovo uses the System Update program to update Software Products on your computer. By default, critical updates are downloaded and installed automatically. Updates are classified as critical when they are needed for the computer to function properly. Failure to install critical updates could result in data corruption or loss, a major system malfunction, or a hardware failure. For example, critical updates could include an update to the hard-disk-drive firmware, a BIOS upgrade, a device-driver fix, or a fix for the operating system or other preinstalled software. You can disable this automatic feature by changing the settings of the System Update program at any time.
"<b>3. Transferability</b>"
You may not transfer or assign the Software Product to any other party, except as permitted in this section.
Preinstalled Software Products are licensed for use only on the Lenovo hardware product on which they are preinstalled or included with and may be transferred only with that Lenovo hardware product. They may not be transferred independent of the Lenovo hardware product.
"<b>4. Third Party Software Products</b>"
Certain third party software products may be included with, or downloaded to this mobile device. Third Party Software Products provided by Lenovo may be governed by the terms of this Agreement but are usually licensed by the Third Party under its own terms and conditions. Third Party Software Products that are not licensed by Lenovo are subject solely to the terms of their accompanying license agreements. Third Party Software Products may collect your information. Make sure you read those license agreements before using third Party Software Products.

The Software Product specifications and specified operating environment information may be found in documentation accompanying the Software Product, if available, such as a README or similarly titled file, or otherwise published by Lenovo.
"<b>6. Software Upgrade</b>"
When connected to the internet, your mobile device will automatically check system updates/upgrades. The process will cause some data transmission. Lenovo will provide software update/upgrade packages to modify bugs or improve your user experiences from time to time.
"<b>7. Charges</b>"
Charges for the Software Product are based on the level of use acquired. 
If You wish to increase the level of use, contact Lenovo or the party from whom You acquired the Software Product. Additional charges may apply. 
If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding those based on Lenovo’s net income, upon the Software Product, then You agree to pay the amount specified or supply exemption documentation. You are responsible for any personal property taxes for the Software Product from the date that You acquire it.
"<b>"8. No Warranty
The Software Product(s) is provided to You \"AS IS.\"
SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, LENOVO MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, REGARDING THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR TECHNICAL SUPPORT, IF ANY.

This limit does not apply to damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property for which Lenovo is required by law to be liable.
This limit also applies to Lenovo's suppliers and resellers. It is the maximum for which Lenovo, its suppliers and resellers are collectively responsible.
"<b>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS LENOVO, ITS SUPPLIERS OR RESELLERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY: 1) THIRD PARTY CLAIMS AGAINST YOU FOR DAMAGES; 2) LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, YOUR DATA; OR 3) SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.
